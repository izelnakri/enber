# mber: Modern Ember.js + Parcel without ember-cli

WARNING: This is highly experimental, you've been warned.

My hobby take on replacing ember-cli with parcel sometime in far future.

## Installation

Install mber CLI:

```
npm install -g mber
```

Check mber CLI commands:

```
mber new [your-app-name]
```

run mber server:

```
mber s
```

Now your development server is running on http://localhost:4200
