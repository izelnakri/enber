# mber: Modern Ember.js + Parcel without ember-cli

WARNING: This is highly experimental, you've been warned.

My hobby take on replacing ember-cli with parcel sometime in far future.

## Installation

Make sure you have node.js v10+ installed. Then install mber CLI:

```
npm install -g mber
```

Check mber CLI commands:

```
mber
```

Create an mber application:

```
mber new [your-app-name]
```

run mber server:

```
mber s
```

Now your development server is running on http://localhost:4200

# CREDITS
This would have been impossible without the great interop libraries, structures, conventions and the framework source code itself which is mainly developed by the ember core team and the community by large.

This library is also a message to inspire and demonstrate Embers superiority in design and community to other frontend developers who are not yet fully knowledgeable of Ember.js framework.

The software is currently in very alpha stage, expect it to become stable shortly with no backward-compatibility promises.
