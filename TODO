simplistic terms.

All I need:
- Ignore ember-cli-build but yet hack all the needed things (vendor + application.js separation):
 - add ember-cli-*plugins interop
- How to do hbs compiling
- Ember resolver logic(app.js)
- Shimming hack
- Working with existing plugin system
- Testing commands
- ember build command with environments
- figure out a way to run fastboot
